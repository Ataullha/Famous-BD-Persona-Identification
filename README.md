### Description of Classifying Famous Bangladeshi Personalities Using Machine Learning Techniques

This machine learning-based web application is designed to classify and identify famous Bangladeshi personalities based on their photographs. By analyzing the visual features of the images and applying advanced algorithms, the application is able to accurately classify and recognize the individuals depicted in the photos.

### Steps for Adding and Preprocessing Additional Dataset for Famous Bangladeshi Personality Classification

- Create a new folder with at least 30-40 images of a specific person, ensuring that the images clearly show their face.
- Rename the folder with the person's name (e.g. Mr Tom).
- Copy or cut and paste the folder into the following directories:
  - [**Famous-BD-Persona-Identification/model/collected_dataset**](https://github.com/Ataullha/Famous-BD-Persona-Identification/tree/main/model/collected_dataset)
  - [**Famous-BD-Persona-Identification/model/dataset**](https://github.com/Ataullha/Famous-BD-Persona-Identification/tree/main/model/dataset)
- Run the following notebooks in the specified order:
  - [**Famous-BD-Persona-Identification/model/rotate_and_zoom_images.ipynb**](https://github.com/Ataullha/Famous-BD-Persona-Identification/blob/main/model/rotate_and_zoom_images.ipynb)
  - [**Famous-BD-Persona-Identification/model/famous_bangladeshi_persona_identification_model.ipynb**](https://github.com/Ataullha/Famous-BD-Persona-Identification/blob/main/model/famous_bangladeshi_persona_identification_model.ipynb)
  
To complete these instructions, you will need to have Python and the required packages installed on your system.
